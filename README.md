# wrightWeatherApp

This is an Angular 1.0 weather app.

The Goals:
  1. Work with the yo angular command in yeoman to scaffold an app together
  2. Fill in data using OpenWeatherMap.org/API specifically (Current weather data & 5 day forecast)
  3. Make the page responsive and be able to swap between the two data sets
  4. Have the app publically avaible when the server is turned on.
  
The Lesson:
  I will be learning how API data is fed into a Javascript framework inside of Node.js server and I will be continuing to improve with yeoman/grunt/gulp.
